# spring-boot-security-jwt-auth
Cleaned up secure version. Assumes you spin up a docker-compose script for mysql.

This can be a good starting point for setting up with security from the get go. Much credit to bezkoder who wrote most of this code. 
I simply improved and refactored it (e.g. now it uses gradle instead of maven). Disconnected from original fork because I intend on diverging a lot and refactoring the structure completely.
